Team: LockyLab, 4 people (2 front-end and 2 back-end developers)

Topic: delivery of information about the wounded from the front

## Project details :newspaper:

There are three stages in which wounded soldiers are admitted. At each of them, there is an opportunity to edit and add the soldier's health status. Doctors can write their notes and give feedback to the doctors so that they know what to do better in the future.
The doctor must be registered in the system and with his unique login and password, he can edit the data on the soldier's condition for further treatment.
The hospital doctor can add new soldiers to the base and view the status of all soldiers from different units.
